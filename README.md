# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple web-based "Guess the Number" game created using PHP and Bootstrap for styling. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and the player continues guessing until they find the correct number.

## Features

2. Enter a guess (a number between 1 and 100).
3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
